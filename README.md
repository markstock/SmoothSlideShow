# SmoothSlideShow
Open all files in a directory and display them in random order with smooth transitions

### Description
SmmothSlideShow is a Processing sketch that will randomly cycle through all png and jpg images
in one directory, without repeating any until they have all been displayed. All images will be
displayed full screen, centered, and scaled to fit the screen. Transitions between
the images will be smooth, and the duration on-screen will vary from 6 to 12 seconds depending on 
the file size (with the assumption that larger images are more interesting).

### Installing
Navigate to your sketches folder or directory and check this repository out there.
