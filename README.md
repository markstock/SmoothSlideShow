# SmoothSlideShow
Open all files in a directory and display them in random order with smooth transitions

### Description
SmoothSlideShow is a Processing sketch that will randomly cycle through all png and jpg images
in one directory, without repeating, until they have all been displayed, then will start over.
All images will be displayed full screen, centered, and scaled to fit the screen. Transitions between
the images will be smooth, and the duration on-screen will vary from 6 to 12 seconds depending on
the file size (the assumption is that larger images are more interesting).

### Installing
Navigate to your sketches folder or directory and check this repository out there.

### Notes
I wrote this because there seemed to be no open-source slideshow program that performed smooth
fades, and I also wanted to adapt the dwell time for each individual image. This program is what
I use for my new media work called MESO, which you can see [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/81qb5u2JTZk).
